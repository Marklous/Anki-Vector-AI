# Anki Vector AI++
[Anki Vector](https://www.anki.com/en-us/vector) - The Home Robot With Interactive AI Technology.

Well, I bought this little guy at 10 Feb 2019, if you want a robot pet, and you want to do some AI programming on it, then I highly recommend you to get Anki Vector.

I build this project to share my codes and docs.

## Object detection with Vector
This program is to enable Vector to detect objects with it's camera, and tell us what it found.

### 1. Install requirements

### 2. How it works

### 3. Run the code yourself
